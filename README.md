# Guess my number

#### This project was built when I was learning JavaScript, I am adding it here to host it for free on github. This is a very baisic game, many people know it as guess my number. This game is a single player game, and just involves luck. Information about the rules, running the game, and contribution are listed down below.

## Rules
#### In this luck based single player game, your goal is to guess the correct number through 1 to 20. Each guess you put will tell you if the number you'r guessing is higher or low, and with each guess your score decreases by 1, try to beat your score every time you play. The higher the score the better.

## Running the game
Running the game is very simple. It is hosted by Github Pages for free. You can run the project [here](https://georgenasseem.github.io/guess-my-number/).
